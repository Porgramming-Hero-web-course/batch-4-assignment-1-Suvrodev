## Question-3: Why are Type Guards Necessary? Discuss Various Types of Type Guards and Their Use Cases.

Let's say I declare a function where the parameters can have different types, such as ` unknown`, `any`, or a union of types like `string | number | boolean`. And there will be many parameters. For example, if I declare two parameters, and both are of type `number`, the function will return the sum of those two numbers. If the first parameter is a `string`, the second parameter will also be converted to a string, and the function will return the string data. Or, let's say if both parameters are `true`, another function will be called. This is where `Type Guards` are used. `Type Guards` help in checking the data type and applying the appropriate functionality or mathematical operations. Therefore, TypeScriptâ€™s Type Guard is very important. Also, TypeScript will show errors before the code runs if the data type is not clearly defined.

**Generally, there are 4 types of Type Guards. They are:**

**1. `typeof Type Guard`**
This can be used to check if a value is a certain primitive type like string, number, or boolean.<br/>
**Example**

```bash
function printLength(value: string | number) {
  if (typeof value === 'string') {
    console.log(value.length);
  } else {
    console.log('Not a string');
  }
}

```

**2. `instanceof ` Type Guard**
This checks whether an object is an instance of a particular class.<br/>
**Example**

```bash
class Dog {
  bark() {
    console.log('Woof!');
  }
}

function makeSound(animal: Dog | string) {
  if (animal instanceof Dog) {
    animal.bark();
  } else {
    console.log('Not a dog!');
  }
}


```

**3. Custom Type Guards (User-Defined)**
Sometimes you may want to create your own checks to distinguish between complex types like objects or interfaces.<br/>
**Example**

```bash
interface Car {
  drive(): void;
}

interface Bike {
  pedal(): void;
}

function isCar(vehicle: Car | Bike): vehicle is Car {
  return (vehicle as Car).drive !== undefined;
}

function useVehicle(vehicle: Car | Bike) {
  if (isCar(vehicle)) {
    vehicle.drive();  // Safe to call drive() because we know it's a Car
  } else {
    vehicle.pedal();  // Safe to call pedal() because we know it's a Bike
  }
}

```

**4. `in` Type Guard**
This checks if a specific property exists in an object. It helps determine the object's shape and type.<br/>
**Example**

```bash
interface Car {
  drive(): void;
}

interface Bike {
  pedal(): void;
}

function useVehicle(vehicle: Car | Bike) {
  if ('drive' in vehicle) {
    vehicle.drive();  // Safe to call drive() because we know it has a drive method
  } else {
    vehicle.pedal();  // Safe to call pedal() because it must be a Bike
  }
}


```
